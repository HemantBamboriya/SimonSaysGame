🟡🔵🔴🟢 How it works (step-by-step)
Buttons with Colors:

There are typically 4 colored buttons: Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow.

1-Each button can light up and play a sound when clicked or activated.

2-Random Sequence Generation:

At the start of the game, the program picks one button randomly and lights it up.

In the next round, it adds one more button to the sequence.

This goes on, increasing the sequence length each round.

3-Player’s Turn:

After the sequence plays (like Green → Blue → Red), the player must repeat the same pattern by clicking the buttons in the same order.

If the player gets it right, they move to the next round with a longer sequence.

4-If the Player Makes a Mistake:

The game shows a “Game Over” message.

Optionally, it can reset the score or allow the player to try again.
